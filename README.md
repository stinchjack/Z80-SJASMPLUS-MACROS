# Z80 Macro Reference

# 8-bit-conditional-branch.macro.asm

## Description

A collection of assembly macros for Z80 8-bit conditional branching and
  flow control using SJASMPlus syntax. These macros encapsulate conditional
  logic based on comparisons of register A and memory values.

## Key Points

All macros perform comparisons only against register A or memory pointed by HL.

The CP instruction is used internally, so flags are affected.

Macros using (HL) read from memory and load value into A, affecting A.

Branch/call/ret destinations accept labels or addresses.

Signed macros carefully handle signed overflow and sign bits.

These macros only deal with 8-bit values.

  SJASMPlus syntax. These macros simplify common patterns for manipulating
  8-bit values in registers and memory.

# conditional-branch.macro.asm

## Description

A collection of flag-based branching, calling, and returning macros for
  conditional flow control on 8-bit values using SJASMPlus syntax.
  These macros rely on flags set by prior instructions (e.g., CP, SUB, another macro).

## Key Points

- These macros depend on flags from previous comparisons (e.g., CP, SUB, another macro).
- No immediate comparison is done inside these macros.
- Branching macros assume A was already compared via CP.
- Signed macros handle overflow and sign using PE/M/P flag logic.
- These macros are designed to be included *after* a comparison has occurred.
- All destinations are absolute jumps /calls.
