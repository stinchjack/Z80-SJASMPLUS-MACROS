# Z80 Macro Reference

# 8-bit-conditional-branch.macro.asm

## Description

A collection of assembly macros for Z80 8-bit conditional branching and
  flow control using SJASMPlus syntax. These macros encapsulate conditional
  logic based on comparisons of register A and memory values.

Usage:
  INCLUDE "8-bit-conditional-branch.macro.asm"

## Key Points

All macros perform comparisons only against register A or memory pointed by HL.

The CP instruction is used internally, so flags are affected.

Macros using (HL) read from memory and load value into A, affecting A.

Branch/call/ret destinations accept labels or addresses.

Signed macros carefully handle signed overflow and sign bits.

These macros only deal with 8-bit values.
